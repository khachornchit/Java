# Java Review

## Core Java Review

This repository serves as a comprehensive review guide for core Java concepts, offering a structured overview of
fundamental topics essential for Java development. It covers essential data types, string manipulation, conditional
statements (if, else, switch), and looping constructs. Additionally, the repository delves into array usage, static
keyword applications, string builder functionality, and techniques for string comparison. Core principles of
collections, including Sets and Lists, are explained, followed by a detailed exploration of HashMaps and LinkedHashMaps.
Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles are covered, emphasizing encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. The
repository concludes with a study of generics, providing a solid foundation for Java developers or those seeking a
refresher on key language features.

## Java8 Review

## Lambda Expressions

Advantage: Lambda expressions enable concise and expressive syntax for writing anonymous functions. This promotes
functional programming paradigms in Java.

Lambda Benefit

* Enables functional programming
* Readable and concise code
* Easier to use APIs and libraries
* Enables support for parallel processing

## Functional Interfaces

Advantage: Functional interfaces, interfaces with a single abstract method, can be used in conjunction with lambda
expressions, promoting a functional programming style.

## Stream API

Advantage: Streams provide a declarative and parallel approach to processing collections, enhancing code readability and
performance.

## Default Methods

Advantage: Default methods allow interfaces to have method implementations, aiding in backward compatibility when adding
new methods to interfaces.

## Date and Time API

Advantage: While not specifically designed for microservices, Java 8's features, especially lambda expressions and the
Streams API, can contribute to writing more modular and scalable code.

## Method References

Advantage: Simplicity and conciseness when calling a static method.

## Method References

* Reference to a Static Method
* Reference to an Instance Method of a Particular Object
* Reference to an Instance Method of an Arbitrary Object of a Particular Type
* Reference to a Constructor

## Optional

* Avoiding Null Checks with Optional
* Chaining Optional Methods
* Default Values with orElse
* Throwing Exceptions with orElseThrow

## Streams

Advantages of Streams:

* Concise and Declarative Syntax: Streams provide a concise and declarative way to express complex data manipulations.
  The code is often more readable and expressive.
* Parallelism: Streams can easily be parallelized, allowing for efficient parallel processing of data. This is
  particularly useful for modern multicore processors.
* No Side Effects: Stream operations do not modify the underlying data source. They are designed to be non-mutating,
  promoting functional programming principles.
* Pipeline of Operations: Stream operations can be chained together to form a pipeline, enabling a sequence of
  operations to be applied to a collection in a single statement.
